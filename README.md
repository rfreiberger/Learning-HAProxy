# Learning-HAProxy
Simple HAProxy demo for learning.

## What is this repo?

I am going over the process of learning [HAProxy](https://www.haproxy.org/) and figured it's a
good idea to create a demo how this works by using [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com) plus
some other tools.

## How can I use this?

You will need the following before getting started.

* Virtualbox - https://virtualbox.com
* Vagrant - https://vagrantup.com
* Git - https://git-scm.com/ (optional, you can download directly from Github)

Once you have those installed, you can continue to the next part.

## Lessons

As I learn each new topic, I'll add another lesson to try it out in
Vagrant for a live example. All of the lessons should be created in
the same method, just ``cd`` into the directory and ``$ vagrant up``.

## Questions or Comments?

You can email me at rob at robaf dot com, or simply create a [new
issue for the problem](https://github.com/rfreiberger/Learning-HAProxy/issues).
